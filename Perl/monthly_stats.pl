  "HELP FOR MONTHLY STATS CONSUMER\n
This script returns summary statistics for the runs on record within
a time interval specified by two dates or timestamps.
-----
Calling StatsDB Perl consumer with command line options:
  -d or --db_config  Database connection specification file (required)
  
  -b or --begin      Beginning of a date range (required)
  -e or --end        End of a date range (optional)
                      (If -b supplied and -e not, all data between
                       -b [date] and current time is returned)
Examples:
- Query between two dates:
 perl monthly_stats.pl -d examples/template_db.txt -b \"15/7/13\" -e \"30/7/2013\"

- Query between two dates, also specifying times:
 perl monthly_stats.pl -d examples/template_db.txt -b \"15/7/13 17:19:21\" -e \"30/7/2013 18:00:36\"

Note that double-quotes around date/time values are recommended.
-----
Output consists of a list of runs, followed by a simple table listing
summary statistics.
-----
Warning: If non-standard QC and primary analyses (for example, RADplex
demultiplexing) are carried out on any of the runs within the time
interval, the number of samples stored in StatsDB may be lower than that
actually produced by the QC/PA pipeline, since this data is not auto-
matically entered into the database.
